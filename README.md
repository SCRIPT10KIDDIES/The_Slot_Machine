# The_Slot_Machine

=> Brief : This is a simple Javascript project that I created, which simulates a game of slot machine.\n


=> The main objective while programming this project was to learn and understand the crux concepts of javascript.\n


=> So, how does this project work?  The user must input his deposit amount,the number of lines(/rows) he's willing to bet for, and the betting amount, and the user inputted data will be checked for validity individually before proceeding to the fun part.Now the reels would be spun at random and the row((/s)-depending upon the number of lines for which the bet has been placed for.) would be checked for winings and returned to the user along with his balance , the game will be terminated once the user's account reaches zero balance or whenever desired.
